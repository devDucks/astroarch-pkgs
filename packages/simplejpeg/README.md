### READ CAREFULLY

On python upgrades simplejpeg needs to be recompiled. But it needs python cmake and that needs to
be recompiled as well. Be sure to compile cmake-python first, install it on your building machine
with sudo pacman -U and then you will be able to successfully compile python-simplejpeg.
